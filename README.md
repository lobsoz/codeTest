Intended Algorithm(couldn't implement it due to time & not being familiar with string & file libraries): 
1. Find all permutations of the input words & store each permutation in a different row in a intermediate file.
2. Open the intermediate file & read each line. If  all the words are valid dictionary words in each line push the line to a results vector.
3. The results vector will have the total number of valid words which are anagrams.
